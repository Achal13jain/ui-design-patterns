# Contributing to UI Aesthetic Atlas

First — thank you. This project gets better with every real-world example, edge case, and perspective the community brings.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Add a Real-World Sighting

The most valuable and easiest contribution. If you spot a live, shipping product that clearly exemplifies one of the 20 patterns:

1. Open an issue using the **"Real-World Sighting"** template
2. Include:
   - The pattern name
   - The product/site name and URL
   - A brief note on *why* it's a strong example — not just that it uses the style, but *how* it uses it well

**Quality bar:** The example should be an unambiguous, well-executed instance of the pattern — not a stretch. When in doubt, open a Discussion first.

### 2. Improve an Editorial Description

If a description is imprecise, outdated, or missing nuance — fix it.

1. Fork the repo
2. Edit the relevant entry in `index.html`
3. Open a PR with a clear title: `fix(description): clarify Neumorphism accessibility constraints`

**Voice to match:** Sharp and opinionated, not encyclopedic. These descriptions should help someone make a decision, not just define a term. "The design language of builders who ship" — not "A style characterized by..."

---

### 3. Submit a New Pattern

New patterns are accepted **selectively**. Before building anything:

1. Open an issue using the **"New Pattern Request"** template
2. Make the case: Is this pattern distinct from existing entries? Is it used in real, shipped products? Does it represent a meaningful aesthetic decision a founder would actually face?
3. **Wait for maintainer approval before building anything**

**If approved, the submission requirements are:**

- A zero-dependency HTML/CSS template that captures the pattern's core visual math
- Pure CSS `@keyframes` on an `infinite` loop (ghost clicks, hover states, natural interactions)
- A 5-second MP4 video captured at **960x640** using headless Chromium
- Video uploaded to Cloudinary CDN — do not commit large binary files to the repo
- A PR with the new entry added to `index.html` (gallery + matrix table) and `README.md` (pattern table) in the correct numbered slot

## Entry Format

When adding or editing a pattern entry in `index.html`, match this structure:

```html
<article class="pattern-entry" data-effort="low|medium|high" data-tags="space-separated tags">
  <div class="pattern-preview">
    <video src="[Cloudinary CDN URL]" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata"
           aria-label="[Pattern Name] design pattern"></video>
  </div>
  <div class="pattern-info">
    <div class="pattern-number">XX / 20</div>
    <h2 class="pattern-name">Pattern<br/>Name</h2>
    <p class="pattern-tagline">One-line tagline. Make it memorable.</p>
    <div class="pattern-meta">
      <div class="meta-row">
        <span class="meta-icon">&#9654;</span>
        <span class="meta-label">Best for</span>
        <span class="meta-value">Use case 1 · Use case 2 · Use case 3</span>
      </div>
      <div class="meta-row">
        <span class="meta-icon">&#9670;</span>
        <span class="meta-label">Effort</span>
        <span class="meta-value">Level — One-sentence honest explanation</span>
      </div>
      <div class="meta-row">
        <span class="meta-icon">&#10005;</span>
        <span class="meta-label">Skip if</span>
        <span class="meta-value">The clearest reason NOT to use this pattern</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pattern-tags">
      <span class="tag">Tag1</span><span class="tag">Tag2</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</article>
```

## What Gets Rejected

- Vague "Best for" tags that apply to everything (e.g., "modern apps")
- Descriptions that don't help someone make a decision
- Patterns that are minor variations of existing entries
- Examples that are low-quality, outdated, or inaccessible
- PRs that bypass the issue/approval step for new patterns

---

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] Editorial voice is sharp and opinionated, not neutral
- [ ] No large binary files committed (videos go via Cloudinary CDN)
- [ ] For new patterns: issue was opened and approved first
- [ ] PR title follows the convention: `feat(pattern): add Typographic UI` or `fix(description): sharpen Brutalism skip-if`

## Code of Conduct

Be direct. Be generous. Disagree with ideas, not people.
