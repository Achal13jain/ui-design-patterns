## Why This Exists

The UI/UX landscape has thousands of component libraries — but almost nothing that answers the question founders *actually* ask at 2am:

> *"What should my product **look like**?"*

This is not a component library. There is no code to copy.

This is a **visual decision-making tool** — a high-fidelity menu of the 20 dominant modern design aesthetics, each captured as a looping HD video preview that shows exactly what the pattern *feels like* in motion. Every entry is paired with a sharp editorial breakdown: who it's for, what it costs to build, and critically — when *not* to use it.

**Stop scrolling Dribbble. Pick a visual identity. Ship.**

## How to Use This

1. **Browse the gallery** — let the motion previews speak before you read a word
2. **Match to your product** — use the Best For tags as a filter
3. **Check the effort** — don't fall in love with Liquid Glass if you ship next week
4. **Commit** — the worst design decision is no decision at all

## Production Pipeline

> This gallery is simple to browse because it was complex to build.

```
HTML/CSS Templates         Playwright Automation          Cloudinary CDN
──────────────────    →    ─────────────────────    →    ─────────────────
Zero-dependency            Headless Chromium              MP4 video, loops
pure CSS @keyframes        960×640, 60fps                 inside gallery
infinite loop              5-second captures              zero repo bloat
```

**How each preview was made:**

1. **Template engineering** — 20 zero-dependency HTML/CSS files, each capturing the precise math of its pattern
2. **Ghost interactions** — Pure CSS `@keyframes` simulate natural user behavior on infinite loops
3. **Headless capture** — A Python/Playwright script spins up headless Chromium at 960&times;640, recording flawless loops
4. **CDN hosting** — MP4 videos are served via Cloudinary CDN, keeping the repository lean while delivering HD previews

**Gallery features:**

- Cinematic page-load sequence with character-by-character hero reveal
- Staggered scroll animations with parallax video previews
- Animated gradient borders on hover
- Filter by effort level or use case
- Vibe &times; Effort decision matrix
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected throughout
- Zero dependencies — single HTML file, pure CSS/JS
